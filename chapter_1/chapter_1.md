## 1. Building Abstractions with Procedures

* Target of study: **computational processes** (1)

  * intuition: "Computational processes are abstract beings that inhabit computers" (1)

* Processes manipulate **data** (1)

* Evolution of a process is directed by a pattern of rules called a **program** (2)

* An upshot: "**People create programs to direct processes**" (2)

### 1.1 The Elements of Programming

### 1.2 Procedures and the Processes They Generate

### 1.3 Formulating Abstractions with Higher-Order Procedures
